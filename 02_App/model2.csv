6,"Long-standing challenges in cluster expansion (CE) construction include choosing how to truncate the expansion and which crystal structures to use for training. Compressive sensing (CS), which is emerging as a powerful tool for model construction in physics, provides a mathematically rigorous framework for addressing these challenges. A recently-developed Bayesian implementation of CS (BCS) provides a parameterless framework, a vast speed-up over current CE construction techniques, and error estimates on model coefficients. Here, we demonstrate the use of BCS to build cluster expansion models for several binary alloy systems. The speed of the method and the accuracy of the resulting fits are shown to be far superior than state-of-the-art evolutionary methods for all alloy systems shown. When combined with high-throughput first-principles frameworks, the implications of BCS are that hundreds of lattice models can be automatically constructed, paving the way to high-throughput thermodynamic modeling of alloys.

4,"Modeling oxygen interstitials in titanium requires a new empirical potential. We optimize potential parameters using a fitting database of first-principle oxygen interstitial energies and forces. A new database optimization algorithm based on Bayesian sampling is applied to obtain an optimal potential for a specific testing set of density functional data. A parallel genetic algorithm minimizes the sum of logistic function evaluations of the testing set predictions. We test the transferability of the potential model against oxygen interstitials in HCP titanium, transition barriers between oxygen interstitial sites, oxygen in the titanium prismatic stacking fault. The potential is applicable to oxygen interaction with the titanium screw dislocation, and predicts that the interactions between oxygen and the dislocation core is weak and short-ranged.",0,1,0,0,1,0

11,"Description of this data

This .zip folder features raw stress-strain tensile data for approximately 500 specimens corresponding to different natural fibre reinforced composite laminates (see Raw Data folder). In addition, we provide here the calculated elastic modulus, strength and failure strain values for each specimen (see Statistics folder). Finally, we include python codes that enables to show the experimental statistical distributions for each material system and calculate the corresponding fit of their probability distribution functions (see Normal.py and Weibull.py files).

The data presented here is associated with the research articles ""Statistical behavior of the tensile properties of natural fibre composites"" and ""The mechanical properties of natural fibre composite laminates: a statistical study"" by J.P.
